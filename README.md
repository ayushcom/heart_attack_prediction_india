# Heart Attack Prediction India

## Objective:    This project explores SQL queries for healthcare analytics using a heart attack prediction dataset. It includes basic, intermediate, and advanced SQL techniques such as filtering, aggregation, subqueries, window functions, and case statements. The goal is to analyze patient health factors, identify risk patterns, and derive meaningful insights to support data-driven decision-making in healthcare."

Analysis and Conclusion

Analysis:

1. The dataset provides insights into heart attack risk factors, including age, cholesterol levels, diabetes, hypertension, and lifestyle habits.

2. SQL queries help analyze high-risk groups by filtering, ranking, and aggregating patient data.

3. Certain states have a higher number of heart attack cases, emphasizing the need for targeted healthcare interventions.

4. Patients with high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and a history of heart disease are more likely to be at risk.

5. Emergency response times vary significantly across states, affecting patient outcomes.

Conclusion:

1. Data-driven analysis is crucial for identifying patterns in heart attack risk and guiding preventive measures.

2. Healthcare policymakers can use such insights to allocate resources efficiently and improve healthcare accessibility.

3. Further analysis can integrate machine learning techniques to predict heart attack risks more accurately.

4. Optimizing emergency response times and promoting healthier lifestyles can significantly reduce the prevalence of heart attacks.
